# What is the effect you're trying to achieve?

I am trying to have a plane that lies on the ocean. I imported the ocean tile, the island tile and boat tile.
Island tile will have a slightly light blue on the background. I have this feature because when the ocean closer to the land, the color of the blue will be lighter.
Also, when the user click of the tile, they will have a flag indicate on the tile. This means the user explore this area.

I think I have Archieve the effect.
